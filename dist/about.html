        <p>
          Hi! I'm Vin, an IT Professional currently working in the Philippines specializing in Progress
          Programming and Web Development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a person who enjoys the simple things in life, a devout Christian and tries to practice the minimalist
          lifestyle. I am a competitive person and believe in the old adage that humans should thrive and not just
          survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I love to do physical activities such as long distance cycling and swimming. I also love
          listening to Original Pinoy Music (OPM).
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a software development enthusiast and I hope that my work will help the world to be a better place.
        </p>
